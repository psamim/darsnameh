* About
I am developing this app to learn Rails. This app
is similar to [[http://darsnameh.com]]. Everyone can enroll
in courses via email, lessons are emailed to students. Each lesson
has one quiz, which is sent to students by email. Grades for each quiz,
course or all enrolled courses can be retrieved using email.
* Install
The app is built as an OpenShift app. You can deploy it following
these steps.
1. Create an account at https://www.openshift.com.
2. Create a rails application.
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    rhc app create railsapp ruby-2.0
   #+END_SRC
4. Add database support to your application.
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    rhc cartridge add -a railsapp -c mysql-5.5
   #+END_SRC
5. Add this repo as upstream.
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    cd railsapp
    git remote add upstream -m master [THIS_REPO]
    git pull -s recursive -X theirs upstream master
   #+END_SRC
6. Push your new code
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    git push
   #+END_SRC
7. That's it!
